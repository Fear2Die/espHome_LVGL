# Changes Made to Spotpear V2

## Overview
Converted the Spotpear V2 configuration from an image-based display system to a modern LVGL-based UI while maintaining full Home Assistant Voice Assistant functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. Display System
**Before:**
- Used downloaded PNG images for each state
- Required `imagemodel` parameter to select character set
- Images loaded from GitHub repository
- Display pages defined with lambda functions drawing images

**After:**
- Native LVGL widgets (labels, objects)
- Color-coded pages for visual distinction
- No external image dependencies
- Cleaner, more maintainable configuration

### 2. Removed Components
- `imagemodel` substitution variable
- All image file definitions (9 image files)
- Image background color definitions
- Font definitions (now handled by LVGL)
- Color definitions (now handled by LVGL)
- `draw_timer_timeline` script (image-based)
- `draw_active_timer_widget` script (image-based)

### 3. Added Components
- LVGL configuration section
- Multiple LVGL pages with widgets
- LVGL-based battery display
- Text labels for request/response display

### 4. Display States (with colors)
| State | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Idle | Dark Gray (#111111) | Ready state with green "Ready" text |
| Listening | Blue (#0000FF) | Actively listening for voice input |
| Thinking | Orange (#FF8800) | Processing the request |
| Replying | Green (#00AA00) | Speaking the response |
| Error | Red (#FF0000) | Error state |
| Muted | Black (#000000) | Microphone muted with red text |
| Timer Finished | Red (#FF0000) | Timer completion alert |
| No WiFi | Yellow (#666600) | WiFi disconnected |
