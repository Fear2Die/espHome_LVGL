# Ball V4 Summary

## Overview
Ball V4 is an enhanced version of Ball V3 with significant improvements to light control, user experience, and screen layout.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Instant Brightness Control ‚ö°
**Problem Solved**: In V3, you had to drag the slider and then release it to apply the brightness change.

**Solution**: Changed slider from `on_release` to `on_value` event handler. Now brightness changes **instantly** as you move the slider.

**User Impact**: More responsive and intuitive control. See the change happen in real-time!

### 2. Percentage-Based Brightness üìä
**Problem Solved**: V3 used 0-255 brightness scale, which is not intuitive for users.

**Solution**: Slider now uses 0-100% scale, matching Home Assistant's standard percentage control.

**User Impact**: Easier to understand and use. "50%" is clearer than "128".

### 3. Fixed Touch Screen Behavior üëÜ
**Problem Solved**: In V3, every time you touched the screen to use controls, it would activate the voice assistant.

**Solution**: Removed voice assistant activation from touch screen events. Voice assistant now only activates via:
- Physical button press
- Wake word detection

**User Impact**: No more accidental voice assistant activation when using light controls!

### 4. Optimized Screen Layout üì±
**Problem Solved**: V3 layout required scrolling to see all controls on the 240x240 screen.

**Solution**: Repositioned all widgets to fit perfectly within the screen:
- Slider: y=60 (was y=70)
- Label: y=90 (was y=105)
- Button: y=130 (was y=150)
- Button height: 45px (was 50px)

**User Impact**: All controls visible at once. No scrolling needed!

### 5. Time Display üïê
**Problem Solved**: No way to see current time on the device.

**Solution**: Added Home Assistant time sensor and display label showing HH:MM format in top-left corner.

**User Impact**: Always know what time it is without additional devices.

### 6. Live Brightness Feedback üí°
**Problem Solved**: Brightness label was static and didn't update as you moved the slider.

**Solution**: Label updates in real-time both from slider movement and external changes from Home Assistant.

**User Impact**: Always see the current brightness percentage.

## Technical Changes

### Configuration Changes
1. **Slider widget**: Changed to 0-100 range with on_value handler
2. **Touch binary sensor**: Removed voice assistant activation logic
3. **Time platform**: Added homeassistant time sensor
4. **Time label**: Added to idle_page with auto-update every minute
5. **Brightness conversion**: Added logic to convert HA brightness (0-255) to percentage (0-100)
6. **Live label update**: Slider on_value updates brightness label

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I upgrade from Ball V3 to Ball V4?
**A**: Yes! Just copy your secrets.yaml, update light entity references, and flash Ball_v4.yaml.

### Q: Will my light automations still work?
**A**: Yes, but if you directly referenced the slider value (0-255), update to percentage (0-100).

### Q: How do I activate voice assistant now?
**A**: Use the physical button on the device, or say the wake word. Touch screen no longer activates it.

### Q: Does instant brightness cause too many HA calls?
**A**: The calls are throttled naturally by how fast you can move the slider. It's not a concern.

### Q: Can I customize the time format?
**A**: Yes, edit the lambda in the time sensor section to change the format.

### Q: What if I want touch to activate voice assistant?
**A**: Restore the original touch handler logic from Ball V3 (not recommended).
