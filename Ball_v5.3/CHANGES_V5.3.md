# Changes from Ball V5.2 to Ball V5.3

## Overview

Ball V5.3 fixes critical layout issues, removes the non-functional camera page, and adds live album art functionality. This release focuses on improving user experience and implementing features that actually work on ESP32 hardware.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Button Overlap Issue ✅

**Problem**: Navigation buttons (Media, Weather, Camera) were overlapping or too close to the toggle light button on the circular display.

**From** (V5.2):
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   ┌───────────────┐     │  y=120 (Toggle button)
│   │ Toggle Light  │     │
│   └───────────────┘     │
│                         │
│ [Media][Weather][Cam]   │  y=-45 (Too close!)
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**To** (V5.3):
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   ┌───────────────┐     │  y=120 (Toggle button)
│   │ Toggle Light  │     │
│   └───────────────┘     │
│                         │
│                         │
│   [Media]  [Weather]    │  y=-10 (Proper spacing!)
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Changes**:
- Navigation buttons moved from y=-45 to y=-10 (BOTTOM_MID alignment)
- Removed camera button (camera page abandoned as non-functional)
- Simplified to 2-button navigation (Media and Weather)
- Button size increased to 90x35 for better touch accuracy
- Provides better spacing on circular display
- Eliminates accidental touches on wrong buttons

**Files Modified**:
- `Ball_v5.3.yaml`: Updated navigation section with 2 buttons instead of 3

### 2. Live Album Art Implementation ✅

**Problem**: Media page showed only a placeholder music note (♪) for album art.

**Solution**: Added live album art display that updates with media changes.

**New Components Added**:

1. **HTTP Request Component** (line 163)
   ```yaml
   http_request:
     timeout: 10s
   ```
   Enables HTTP requests to Home Assistant API.

2. **Online Image Component** (line 166)
   ```yaml
   online_image:
     - id: album_art_image
       url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123/"  # Placeholder - set dynamically from entity_picture
       type: RGB565
       format: PNG
       resize: 60x60
       update_interval: never  # Updated manually when media changes
   ```
   - Fetches album art from media player entity_picture
   - Resizes to 60x60 to fit media page layout
   - Uses RGB565 internal color format for memory efficiency
   - Supports PNG/JPEG album art images from Home Assistant

3. **Text Sensor for Album Art URL** (line 1145)
   ```yaml
   - platform: homeassistant
     id: ha_media_picture
     entity_id: ${media_player_entity}
     attribute: entity_picture
     on_value:
       - lambda: |-
           if (x.length() > 0 && x[0] == '/') {
             auto url = "http://homeassistant.local:8123" + x;
             id(album_art_image).set_url(url.c_str());
           } else if (x.length() > 0) {
             id(album_art_image).set_url(x.c_str());
           }
   ```
   - Fetches entity_picture attribute from media player
   - Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs
   - Updates album art image when media changes

4. **Media Page Widget Update**
   ```yaml
   # Before (V5.2): Placeholder container with music note
   - obj:
       id: album_art_container
       widgets:
         - label:
             text: "♪"
   
   # After (V5.3): Actual image widget
   - image:
       id: album_art_display
       src: album_art_image
   ```

**Album Art Features**:
- ✅ Live album art from media player
- ✅ Automatic updates when media changes
- ✅ Memory-efficient RGB565 format
- ✅ Proper resolution (60x60 pixels)
- ✅ Works with Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.

**Technical Details**:
- Uses Home Assistant media player entity_picture attribute
- Requires ESPHome 2023.7.0+ for online_image platform
- No authentication needed if on same network
- Falls back to empty image if no album art available

---

### 3. Camera Page Removal ✅

**Problem**: Camera page was not working properly and added unnecessary complexity.

**Solution**: Removed camera page entirely to simplify navigation and focus on working features.

**Changes Made**:
- Removed camera navigation button from idle page
- Removed entire camera_page from LVGL configuration
- Removed camera_entity from substitutions
- Repurposed http_request and online_image for album art instead

---

## Technical Changes

### Version Information Updated
```yaml
substitutions:
  name: ball_v53                    # Changed from ball_v52
  friendly_name: "Ball V5.3"        # Changed from "Ball V5.2"
```

### Component Requirements Added
- `http_request`: For API access
- `online_image`: For dynamic image fetching (requires ESPHome 2023.7.0+)

### LVGL Widget Changes

**Navigation Buttons**:
```yaml
# Before (V5.2): 3 buttons at y=-45
- button: { x: -80, y: -45, width: 70, height: 30 }  # Media
- button: { x: 0, y: -45, width: 70, height: 30 }    # Weather
- button: { x: 80, y: -45, width: 70, height: 30 }   # Camera

# After (V5.3): 2 buttons at y=-10
- button: { x: -50, y: -10, width: 90, height: 35 }  # Media
- button: { x: 50, y: -10, width: 90, height: 35 }   # Weather
```

**Album Art Display**:
```yaml
# Before (V5.2): Placeholder with label
- obj:
    id: album_art_container
    widgets:
      - label:
          text: "♪"

# After (V5.3): Actual image widget
- image:
    id: album_art_display
    src: album_art_image
```

## Breaking Changes

**Minor changes only** - V5.3 is mostly backward compatible with V5.2 configurations.

### Migration from V5.2

1. Replace `Ball_v5.2.yaml` with `Ball_v5.3.yaml`
2. Remove `camera_entity` from substitutions (no longer needed)
3. Flash to device
4. Album art will start displaying automatically when playing media

**Configuration changes**:
- Camera entity no longer needed
- All other settings remain the same

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Button Overlap ✅
- **Issue**: Navigation buttons too close to toggle light on circular display
- **Fix**: Moved buttons to y=-10 for proper spacing
- **Impact**: Better touch accuracy, no more accidental presses

### 2. Album Art Not Displaying ✅
- **Issue**: Media page showed only placeholder music note
- **Fix**: Added online_image component and entity_picture text sensor
- **Impact**: Users can now see album art for currently playing media

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Using V5.3

1. **Verify Home Assistant Access**
   - Ensure ESP32 can reach `homeassistant.local:8123`
   - Test media player entity has entity_picture attribute

2. **Check ESPHome Version**
   - V5.3 requires ESPHome 2023.7.0+ for online_image
   - Update ESPHome if needed: `pip install -U esphome`

3. **Media Player Configuration**
   - Verify media player entity ID in substitutions
   - Test media player works in Home Assistant first
   - Use media player with album art (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.)

### After Flashing V5.3

1. **Test Navigation Buttons**
   - Verify no overlap with toggle light
   - Check both buttons respond correctly
   - Test touch accuracy

2. **Test Album Art Display**
   - Navigate to media page
   - Start playing media with album art
   - Verify image displays correctly
   - Check updates when media changes

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - Watch for HTTP request errors
   - Check memory usage (online_image uses RAM)
   - Verify album art updates when media changes

---

## Known Limitations

### Album Art Display
- **Network**: Requires stable WiFi connection to Home Assistant
- **Memory**: Uses more RAM than V5.2 (due to image buffering)
- **Compatibility**: Only works with media players that provide entity_picture attribute

### Performance
- First album art load may take 5-10 seconds
- Image quality depends on source resolution
- Album art updates when media changes (not real-time)
