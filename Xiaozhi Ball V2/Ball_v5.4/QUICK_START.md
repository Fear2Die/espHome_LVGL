5. Ball should appear there

### Light Control Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Slider/button doesn't control light

**Solutions:**
1. Check entity ID in Ball_v5.4.yaml - correct?
2. Check entity ID in Home Assistant - still exists?
3. Try controlling light from Home Assistant directly
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### Media Player Shows "No Media"

**Problem:** Always shows "No media" even when playing

**Solutions:**
