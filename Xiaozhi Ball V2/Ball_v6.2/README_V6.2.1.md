# Ball V6.2.1 - README

## What is Ball V6.2.1?

Ball V6.2.1 is a stability and feature update that improves the ESPHome Xiaozhi Ball smart display experience with three key enhancements:

1. **Fixed volume slider bouncing** - Smooth, instant volume control
2. **Progress arc validation** - Auto-correcting position tracking
3. **Optional inactivity timeout** - Auto-return to main screen (disabled by default)

---

## Quick Start

### For New Users

1. **Download** `Ball_v6.2.yaml` from this directory
2. **Edit** lines 11-26 to set your Home Assistant entity IDs
3. **Flash** to your device using ESPHome
4. **Enjoy** improved media control!

### For V6.2 Users Upgrading

1. **Backup** your current `Ball_v6.2.yaml`
2. **Replace** with the new version from this directory
3. **Flash** to device (takes ~30 seconds)
4. **Test** the volume slider - should be smooth now!

No configuration changes needed - all improvements work automatically.

---

## What's New?

### üéµ Volume Slider Now Smooth

**The Problem**: Volume slider was bouncing up and down when adjusting.

**The Fix**: Applied the same anti-bounce pattern used by the light brightness slider.

**The Result**: 
- ‚úÖ Instant response to your touch
- ‚úÖ No jumping or bouncing
- ‚úÖ Reliable volume control

**No action needed** - this works automatically!

---

### üìä Progress Arc Self-Correcting

**The Problem**: Long songs or network issues could cause the progress arc to drift from actual position.

**The Fix**: Added automatic validation that checks and corrects drift every 5+ seconds.

**The Result**:
- ‚úÖ Smooth animation every second (existing)
- ‚úÖ Auto-corrects if off by 2+ seconds (new)
- ‚úÖ Accurate position even after seeking
- ‚úÖ No drift during long playback

**No action needed** - validation runs automatically!

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Inactivity Timeout Ready

**The Request**: Add auto-return to main screen, but keep it disabled.

**The Implementation**: Complete feature added as commented code with clear activation instructions.

**When Enabled**:
- After 60 seconds of no touch ‚Üí Returns to main screen
- Only on media/weather screens (not main)
- Any touch resets the timer
- Fully configurable

**Action Required**: Only if you want this feature - see activation guide below.

## How to Enable Inactivity Timeout

**Want the screen to return to main after 60 seconds of inactivity?**

### Quick 4-Step Activation:

1. Open `Ball_v6.2.yaml` in a text editor

2. **Uncomment the global variable** (~line 1233):
   ```yaml
   # Remove the # from these lines:
   - id: last_interaction_time
     type: unsigned long
     restore_value: no
     initial_value: '0'
   ```

3. **Uncomment touch tracking** (~line 446):
   ```yaml
   # Remove the # from this line:
   id(last_interaction_time) = millis();
   ```

4. **Uncomment the interval** (~line 421):
   ```yaml
   # Remove the # from these lines:
   interval:
     - interval: 10s
       then:
         - script.execute: check_inactivity
   ```

5. **Uncomment the script** (~line 1013):
   ```yaml
   # Remove the # from all lines of the check_inactivity script
   - id: check_inactivity
     then:
       # ... (keep uncommenting all lines)
   ```

6. **Flash** to device

**Tip**: Search for "INACTIVITY TIMEOUT" in the YAML file - all 4 sections are clearly marked!

For detailed instructions with screenshots, see **QUICK_REFERENCE_V6.2.1.md**.

- ‚úÖ ESP32 / ESP32-S3
- ‚úÖ All media players with standard attributes

### Requirements
- Home Assistant connection
- Media player with `volume_level`, `media_position`, `media_duration` attributes
- Time component synced with HA

---

## Upgrade Notes

### From V6.2
- **Breaking changes**: None
- **Configuration changes**: None required
- **Flash time**: ~30 seconds
- **Data loss**: None
- **Rollback**: Simple (restore backup)

### From Earlier Versions
- Upgrade to V6.2 first, then to V6.2.1

---

## Testing Your Installation

### Test 1: Volume Slider
1. Open media screen
2. Rapidly move volume slider up and down
3. ‚úÖ Should be smooth with no bouncing

### Test 2: Progress Arc
1. Play a 3+ minute song
2. Watch arc animate smoothly
3. Skip forward/backward
4. ‚úÖ Arc should correct within 5 seconds

### Test 3: Inactivity Timeout (if enabled)
1. Navigate to media screen
2. Don't touch for 60 seconds
3. ‚úÖ Should return to main screen

---

## Troubleshooting

### Volume slider still bouncing?
- Check Home Assistant connection
- Verify `${media_player_entity}` is correct
- Review ESPHome logs for errors
- Try reflashing device

### Progress arc not updating?
- Verify media is playing in HA
- Check `media_position` attribute exists
- Ensure time component is synced
- Review sensor logs

### Inactivity timeout not working?
- Verify all 4 sections are uncommented
- Check for YAML syntax errors
- Look for script errors in logs
- Confirm global variable is defined

## Performance

- **Memory**: +8 bytes (only if inactivity timeout enabled)
- **CPU**: Negligible increase (~0.01%)
- **Network**: No additional calls
- **Battery**: No impact
- **Responsiveness**: Improved (volume slider)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Inactivity timeout**: Disabled by default (requires manual activation)
2. **Progress validation**: 5-second minimum interval (prevents excessive checking)
3. **Drift tolerance**: 2-second threshold (avoids corrections for minor differences)

All thresholds are configurable - see **CHANGES_V6.2.1.md** for details.
