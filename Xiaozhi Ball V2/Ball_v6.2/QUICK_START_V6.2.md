## Testing (3 Things)

### 1. Volume Slider Position ‚úÖ
- Navigate to media screen
- Slider should be on left side
- Should not overlap with any UI elements

### 2. Progress Arc ‚úÖ
- Play a song
- Watch the green arc around album art
- **Should update every second** (not just when paused!)
- Pause ‚Üí arc should freeze
- Resume ‚Üí arc should continue

### 3. Album Art ‚úÖ
- Play music from Spotify/YouTube Music
- Album cover should appear within 5-10 seconds
- Should work with JPEG images now!

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Progress arc not animating
**Check**: 
- Is media actually playing? (check Home Assistant)
- Does your media player provide `media_position`?

### Problem: No album art
**Check**:
- Does your media player have `entity_picture` attribute?
- Can ESP32 reach Home Assistant network?
- Try with different music source (Spotify, etc.)

### Problem: Slider in wrong position
**Fix**: Edit line 1509, change y value:
- Current: `-30`
- Lower on screen: `-25` or `-20`
- Higher on screen: `-35` or `-40`
