# Ball V6.4 - Validation Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist to validate all V6.4 changes.

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### Code Review Checklist

- [x] **Global flag added**: `updating_volume_from_ha` exists (line 1112-1115)
- [x] **Sensor protection**: Volume sensor sets/clears flag (lines 285, 289)
- [x] **Slider check**: Volume slider checks flag before calling HA (line 1477)
- [x] **Time trigger**: Progress arc updates every second (line 347-359)
- [x] **Slider position**: Volume slider moved to x=41 (line 1456)
- [x] **Interaction flags**: Both sliders set slider_interaction (lines 1339, 1341, 1470, 1473)

### Syntax Validation

```bash
# Check for common YAML issues
grep -n "^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*if:" Ball_v6.yaml
grep -n "lambda:" Ball_v6.yaml | wc -l
grep -n "on_value:" Ball_v6.yaml | wc -l
```

Expected results:
- Multiple `if:` statements (no syntax errors)
- Multiple lambda functions (properly formatted)
- Multiple on_value triggers (properly indented)

### Mathematical Verification

```python
# Slider position calculation
import math

center_x, center_y, radius = 120, 120, 120
slider_x, slider_y, slider_h = 41, 0, 180
slider_w = 15

# Calculate corner distances
corners = [
    (slider_x, center_y - slider_h/2),
    (slider_x + slider_w, center_y - slider_h/2),
    (slider_x, center_y + slider_h/2),
    (slider_x + slider_w, center_y + slider_h/2),
]

for x, y in corners:
    dist = math.sqrt((x - center_x)**2 + (y - center_y)**2)
    assert dist <= radius, f"Corner ({x}, {y}) outside circle at {dist}px"

print("✓ All corners within circular display")
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Volume Slider Feedback Loop Protection

#### Test 1.1: HA → Device Update
```
Steps:
1. Note current volume on Ball V6 (e.g., 50%)
2. Open Home Assistant media player card
3. Change volume to different value (e.g., 75%)
4. Observe Ball V6 slider

Expected:
- Slider smoothly updates to 75%
- No bouncing or oscillation
- Slider stays at 75%

Result: [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Notes: ___________________________________
```

#### Test 1.2: Device → HA Update
```
Steps:
1. Note current volume in HA
2. Adjust slider on Ball V6 to new position
3. Check Home Assistant media player volume

Expected:
- HA volume matches slider position
- Change reflected within 1 second
- No feedback loop or bouncing

Result: [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Notes: ___________________________________
```

#### Test 1.3: Rapid HA Changes
```
Steps:
1. In Home Assistant, rapidly change volume:
   - 0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
2. Observe Ball V6 slider behavior

Expected:
- Slider tracks all changes
- No oscillation between values
- Smooth transitions
- Ends at final value (100%)

Result: [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Notes: ___________________________________
```

Result: [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Notes: ___________________________________
```

#### Test 2.3: Accuracy Check
```
Steps:
1. Note song duration (e.g., 180 seconds)
2. Note current playback time (e.g., 90 seconds)
3. Calculate expected %: (90/180) * 100 = 50%
4. Compare with arc display

Expected:
- Arc position matches calculated %
- Tolerance: ±2% acceptable
- Visual alignment with expected progress

Result: [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
Expected: _____% | Actual: _____%
Notes: ___________________________________
