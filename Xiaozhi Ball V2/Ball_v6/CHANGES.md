## 🎨 New Features

### 1. Swipe Gesture Navigation

**What's New:**
- Touch-based swipe detection for page navigation
- Horizontal swipes change pages naturally
- Minimum swipe distance: 50 pixels
- Swipe gestures work alongside button navigation

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
touchscreen:
  on_release:
    - lambda: |-
        int dx = touch.x - id(swipe_start_x);
        int dy = touch.y - id(swipe_start_y);
        
        if (abs(dx) > 50 && abs(dx) > abs(dy) * 1.5) {
          // Navigate based on swipe direction
        }
```

**Why This Matters:**
- More natural interaction on touch displays
- Faster navigation than button taps
- Common pattern users expect from mobile devices
- Reduces need for visible navigation buttons

---

### 2. Circular Progress Indicators

**What's New:**
- Replaced linear sliders with circular arc controls
- Brightness: 270-degree arc around center of idle page
- Volume: 90-degree arc at bottom of media page
- Visual feedback matches circular display geometry

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
- arc:
    id: brightness_arc
    width: 200
    height: 200
    start_angle: 135
    end_angle: 45
    arc_width: 8
    adjustable: true
```

**Why This Matters:**
- More intuitive on circular displays
- Visual representation of current value
- Modern, polished appearance
- Better use of circular screen real estate

---

### 3. Color Theme Support

**What's New:**
- Multiple color themes controllable from Home Assistant
- 5 built-in themes: Dark, Blue, Purple, Green, Orange
- Dynamic updates to all UI elements
- Theme state persists across reboots

**Available Themes:**
| Theme | Background | Accent | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Dark | #111111 | #FFCC66 | Default, low light |
| Blue | #0a1929 | #4fc3f7 | Cool, modern |
| Purple | #1a0a29 | #ce93d8 | Royal, elegant |
| Green | #0a291a | #81c784 | Natural, calm |
| Orange | #291a0a | #ffb74d | Warm, vibrant |

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `input_select` entity in Home Assistant
- Text sensor monitors theme changes
- Lambda applies colors dynamically to arcs, backgrounds, buttons

**Why This Matters:**
- Personalization and user preference
- Match room lighting or mood
- Better visibility in different lighting conditions
- Easy to add custom themes

---

### 4. Radial Menu System

**What's New:**
- Circular button layout for navigation
- Buttons positioned around center point
- Uses Unicode symbols (♫, ☀) for visual clarity
- Color-coded borders match destination page

**Layout:**
- Media button: Left side (-75px X offset)
- Weather button: Right side (+75px X offset)
- 60x60 circular buttons
- 3px colored borders

**Why This Matters:**
- More natural for circular displays
- Better visual balance
- Easier to reach with thumb
- Professional appearance

---

### 5. Enhanced Timer/Alarm Display

**What's New:**
- Circular countdown arc when timer is active
- Red arc (#FF6666) fills as timer counts down
- Timer label shows remaining time
- Auto-hides when no timer active

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
- arc:
    id: timer_arc
    width: 220
    height: 220
    arc_color: 0xFF6666
    hidden: true  # Shows when timer active
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Immediate visual feedback
- Natural circular countdown
- Non-intrusive when not needed
- Clear time remaining

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Theme entity not found

**Solution:** Ensure ESPHome version 2025.5.0+ with LVGL arc support

### Issue: Swipe too sensitive
**Solution:** Increase minimum swipe distance in touchscreen lambda

### Issue: Colors don't match theme
**Solution:** Check theme name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
