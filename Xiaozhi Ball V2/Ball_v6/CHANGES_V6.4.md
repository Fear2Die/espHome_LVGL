# Ball V6.4 Changes

This document describes the changes made in Ball V6.4 to address issues with the volume slider, progress arc, and screen layout.

## Problem Statement

From the user:
> ball v6 the sound slider is bouncing up and down. it should reflect the real state of the sound only after a modification the priority should be the value of HA not the device. Also make it so that the music progress arc is being updated constantly and not only when i pause the media. the volume slider is still being cut off by the lack of screen, check mathematicaly the possitions so that nothing overlaps and fits , remember its a 240x240 circular screen. Also make it so that when i use sliders it doesnt change pages (currently it only applies to the main page, i want it to applie to all slides including the volume slider.)

## Changes Made

### 1. Volume Slider Bouncing Fix ✅

**Problem**: Volume slider was bouncing up and down because Home Assistant updates were triggering slider `on_value` events, which in turn called Home Assistant again, creating a feedback loop.

**Solution**: Implemented the same protection pattern used for the light brightness slider in V5.1.

**Implementation**:

#### Added Global Flag (line 1112-1115)
```yaml
- id: updating_volume_from_ha
  type: bool
  restore_value: no
  initial_value: 'false'
```

#### Updated Volume Sensor to Set Flag (lines 285-289)
```yaml
on_value:
  - lambda: 'id(updating_volume_from_ha) = true;'
  - lvgl.slider.update:
      id: media_volume_slider
      value: !lambda 'return x * 100.0;'
  - lambda: 'id(updating_volume_from_ha) = false;'
```

#### Updated Volume Slider to Check Flag (lines 1474-1483)
```yaml
on_value:
  - if:
      condition:
        lambda: 'return !id(updating_volume_from_ha);'
      then:
        - homeassistant.action:
            action: media_player.volume_set
            data:
              entity_id: ${media_player_entity}
              volume_level: !lambda 'return x / 100.0;'
```

**How It Works**:
1. **User moves slider** → Flag is false → HA call allowed ✓
2. **HA updates volume** → Sensor sets flag → Slider updates → HA call blocked ✓
3. **Flag auto-clears** → Ready for next user action ✓

**Result**: Volume slider now reflects Home Assistant state as the priority source. User changes still propagate to HA, but HA changes don't create a feedback loop.

### 2. Continuous Progress Arc Updates ✅

**Problem**: Progress arc only updated when media position or duration sensors triggered from Home Assistant. This meant the arc didn't animate smoothly during playback and didn't update at all when media was paused.

**Solution**: Added a time-based update that recalculates progress every second.

**Implementation** (lines 347-359):
```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_time
    on_time:
      # Update progress arc every second when media is playing
      - seconds: '*'
        then:
          - lvgl.arc.update:
              id: media_progress_arc
              value: !lambda |-
                float position = id(ha_media_position).state;
                float duration = id(ha_media_duration).state;
                if (duration > 0 && !std::isnan(position) && !std::isnan(duration)) {
                  return (position / duration) * 100.0;
                } else {
                  return 0;
                }
```

**How It Works**:
- Every second, the progress arc is recalculated using the latest position and duration sensor values
- The sensors still update from Home Assistant when available
- The time-based update ensures smooth animation even if sensors don't trigger frequently
- Progress continues to animate during playback without waiting for sensor updates

**Result**: Progress arc now updates continuously every second, providing smooth visual feedback of media playback progress.

### 3. Volume Slider Position Fix ✅

**Problem**: Volume slider was positioned at x=15, which placed it outside the visible circular display area at the top and bottom edges.

**Analysis**:
For a 240×240 circular display:
- Center: (120, 120)
- Radius: 120 pixels
- Slider with height=180 extends from y=30 to y=210 (±90 pixels from center)
- At y=30 or y=210, the safe horizontal distance from center is: √(120² - 90²) ≈ 79.4 pixels
- Safe left edge: 120 - 79.4 = 40.6 pixels minimum
- Previous position (x=15) was outside the visible circle

**Mathematical Verification**:
```
Old position (x=15):
  Corner (15, 30):  distance = 138.29 pixels > 120 radius ✗ OUTSIDE
  Corner (30, 30):  distance = 127.28 pixels > 120 radius ✗ OUTSIDE

New position (x=41):
  Corner (41, 30):  distance = 119.75 pixels < 120 radius ✓ INSIDE
  Corner (56, 30):  distance = 110.44 pixels < 120 radius ✓ INSIDE
```

**Implementation** (line 1456):
```yaml
- slider:
    id: media_volume_slider
    align: LEFT_MID
    x: 41  # Changed from 15
    y: 0
    width: 15
    height: 180
```

**Result**: Volume slider now fits completely within the visible circular display. All four corners of the slider are within the 120-pixel radius, with a 14-pixel gap between the slider (ending at x=56) and the album art (starting at x=70).

### 4. Slider Interaction Blocking Page Changes ✅

**Problem Statement**: User wanted to ensure sliders don't trigger page changes during interaction, applying to all pages including the volume slider.

**Finding**: This feature was already implemented correctly! Both sliders (light brightness and media volume) already set the `slider_interaction` flag.

**Current Implementation**:
- **Global Flag** (line 1113): `slider_interaction` tracks when any slider is being used
- **Light Slider** (lines 1339-1341): Sets flag on press/release
- **Volume Slider** (lines 1470-1473): Sets flag on press/release
- **Swipe Detection** (line 387): Checks `!id(slider_interaction)` before processing swipes

**Code**:
```yaml
# Touch on_release swipe detection
- lambda: |-
    if (id(swipe_in_progress) && !id(slider_interaction) && ...) {
      // Process swipe only if NO slider is being touched
    }
```

**How It Works**:
1. User touches any slider → `slider_interaction = true`
2. User swipes → Swipe detection checks flag → Swipe blocked ✓
3. User releases slider → `slider_interaction = false`
4. Next swipe → Swipe detection works normally ✓

**Result**: No changes needed. The system already blocks page changes when ANY slider on ANY page is being interacted with.

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Volume Slider Bouncing ✅
1. Play media on your media player
2. Adjust volume from Home Assistant UI
3. **Verify**: Slider on Ball V6 updates smoothly without bouncing
4. Adjust volume slider on Ball V6
5. **Verify**: Volume changes in Home Assistant
6. Rapidly change volume in HA multiple times
7. **Verify**: Slider follows smoothly without feedback loop

**Expected Behavior**:
- HA volume change → Slider updates smoothly (no bounce)
- Slider adjustment → HA volume updates
- No oscillation or flickering

---

### 2. Progress Arc Updates ✅
1. Play media on your media player
2. **Verify**: Progress arc animates smoothly every second
3. Pause media
4. **Verify**: Progress arc stays at current position (still updates every second from last known position)
5. Resume media
6. **Verify**: Progress arc continues animating from where it was

**Expected Behavior**:
- Arc updates every second during playback
- Arc shows real-time progress (0-100%)
- Smooth animation, no jumps

---

### 3. Slider Position ✅
1. View media screen on Ball V6
2. **Verify**: Volume slider is fully visible (not cut off at top/bottom)
3. Check all four corners of slider are within the circular display
4. **Verify**: No overlap with album art or other elements

**Expected Behavior**:
- Slider fully visible within circular screen
- 14-pixel gap between slider and album art
- All corners within 120-pixel radius

---

### 4. Slider Interaction ✅
1. On main screen, touch and hold brightness slider
2. While holding, try to swipe left/right
3. **Verify**: Page does NOT change while holding slider
4. Release slider and swipe
5. **Verify**: Page changes normally
6. Repeat on media screen with volume slider
7. **Verify**: Same behavior (no page change while touching slider)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Touching any slider blocks all swipe navigation
- Releasing slider re-enables swipe navigation
- Works on all pages with sliders

## Technical Details

### Protection Flag Pattern

This pattern prevents feedback loops between device UI and Home Assistant:

```yaml
# Global flag
globals:
  - id: updating_<widget>_from_ha
    type: bool
    initial_value: 'false'

# Sensor sets flag before updating UI
sensor:
  on_value:
    - lambda: 'id(updating_<widget>_from_ha) = true;'
    - lvgl.<widget>.update: ...
    - lambda: 'id(updating_<widget>_from_ha) = false;'

# Widget checks flag before calling HA
widget:
  on_value:
    - if:
        condition:
          lambda: 'return !id(updating_<widget>_from_ha);'
        then:
          - homeassistant.action: ...
```

### Circular Display Safe Zone

For elements at the vertical extremes (y far from 120):
```
safe_x = center_x - sqrt(radius² - (y - center_y)²)
```

For slider with height=180 (y from 30 to 210):
```
y_offset = 90 pixels from center
safe_x = 120 - sqrt(120² - 90²)
       = 120 - sqrt(6300)
       = 120 - 79.4
       ≈ 41 pixels
```
