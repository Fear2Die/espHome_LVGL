## Technical Details

### Home Assistant Requirements

Your media player entity must support these attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `volume_level` | 0.0 - 1.0 | Volume control |
| `media_position` | seconds | Current position |
| `media_duration` | seconds | Total duration |
| `entity_picture` | URL | Album art image |

Most media_player integrations include these by default.

### Supported Media Players
- ✅ Spotify
- ✅ Google Cast
- ✅ YouTube Music
- ✅ Apple Music
- ✅ Plex
- ✅ Sonos
- ✅ MPD
- ✅ VLC

### ESPHome Version
- **Minimum**: 2025.5.0
- **Recommended**: Latest stable release

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Arc Not Moving
**Symptoms**: Arc stays at 0% or doesn't update

**Checks**:
1. Verify media is playing in Home Assistant
2. Check media player has `media_position` attribute
3. Ensure media player has `media_duration` attribute
4. Refresh ESPHome device if just upgraded

**Fix**: Most media players update position every 1 second

---

### Volume Slider Not Syncing
**Symptoms**: Slider doesn't match HA volume

**Checks**:
1. Verify media player has `volume_level` attribute
2. Check entity ID in config matches your player
3. Try adjusting volume in HA, wait 1-2 seconds
4. Refresh ESPHome device if just upgraded

**Fix**: Sensor updates when volume changes in HA

---

### Album Art Not Loading
**Symptoms**: No image appears, or placeholder shown

**Checks**:
1. Verify media player has `entity_picture` attribute
2. Check network connection to Home Assistant
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for image to load
4. Try different media source (Spotify, YouTube Music)

**Fix**: First load takes 5-10 seconds, then caches

---

### Volume Slider Looks Too Tall/Short
**Symptoms**: Slider clips at edges or looks wrong

**Issue**: This should be fixed in V6.3!

**If Still Occurs**:
1. Verify you're on V6.3 (check line 1441 in YAML)
2. Height should be 180px (not 200px)
3. Re-flash device if showing old version

---

## Configuration Tips

### Custom Home Assistant URL
If your HA isn't at `homeassistant.local:8123`:

```yaml
# Find this line in text_sensor section (~line 1149)
auto url = "http://homeassistant.local:8123" + x;

# Change to your HA address:
auto url = "http://192.168.1.100:8123" + x;
```

### Different Media Player Entity
```yaml
# In substitutions section (top of file)
media_player_entity: "media_player.YOUR_PLAYER"

# Examples:
media_player_entity: "media_player.spotify"
media_player_entity: "media_player.living_room_speaker"
media_player_entity: "media_player.plex_chrome"
```

### Adjust Progress Arc Color
```yaml
# Find media_progress_arc widget (~line 1407)
indicator:
  arc_color: 0x1DB954  # Spotify green

# Change to your preferred color:
# Red: 0xFF0000
# Blue: 0x0000FF
# Purple: 0x800080
# Orange: 0xFF8800
```
