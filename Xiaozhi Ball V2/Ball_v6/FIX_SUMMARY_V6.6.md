# Ball V6.6 - Fix Summary

Quick reference for the changes in Ball V6.6.

## What Was Fixed?

### ✅ Timestamp Conversion Error
**Error Message**: `Can't convert '2025-10-11 11:17:53.427312+00:00' to number!`

**Fixed**: Removed the problematic sensor that tried to read a timestamp string as a number.

---

### ✅ Volume Slider Bouncing
**Problem**: Slider was jumpy and didn't stay where you set it.

**Fixed**: Volume is now only set when you release the slider, not continuously while dragging.

---

## How It Works Now

### Volume Slider Behavior

**Before V6.6** ❌:
```
User drags slider
  ↓ (continuous events)
Send to Home Assistant
  ↓ (continuous responses)
HA sends back volume
  ↓ (causes bouncing)
Slider jumps around
```

**After V6.6** ✅:
```
User touches slider → Block HA updates
  ↓
User drags slider → Smooth local movement
  ↓
User releases slider → Send final value to HA
  ↓
HA sends back confirmation → Throttled update (200ms)
  ↓
Slider stays exactly where set
```

## Key Improvements

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Slider Updates** | Continuous during drag | Single update on release |
| **HA Calls** | Many per drag | One per drag |
| **Bouncing** | Yes, noticeable | None |
| **Responsiveness** | Sluggish | Instant |
| **Errors in logs** | Timestamp conversion errors | None |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to media screen
- [ ] Touch and drag volume slider
- [ ] **Expected**: Slider moves smoothly, no jumps
- [ ] Release slider
- [ ] **Expected**: Volume changes in HA to match
- [ ] Change volume from HA
- [ ] **Expected**: Slider updates smoothly
- [ ] Check ESPHome logs
- [ ] **Expected**: No timestamp errors

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `Ball_v6.yaml` (2 sections updated, 1 sensor removed)

### Lines Changed
- **Added**: 3 lines (throttle filter, delay)
- **Removed**: ~50 lines (timestamp sensor, real-time calc)
- **Modified**: 2 lines (moved HA call)
- **Net**: -47 lines (simpler!)

### Sensors Changed
1. **Volume Sensor** (`ha_media_volume`):
   - Added `throttle: 200ms` filter
   - Added `delay: 100ms` before clearing flag

2. **Removed Sensor** (`ha_media_position_updated_at`):
   - Was causing timestamp conversion errors
   - No longer needed

### UI Changes
1. **Volume Slider**:
   - Moved HA call from `on_value` to `on_release`
   - Now gets final value with `get_value()` method

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Backup your current `Ball_v6.yaml`
2. Replace with V6.6 version
3. Ensure your entity IDs are set in substitutions
4. Flash to device
5. Test volume slider

**No breaking changes** - all features work as before, just better!

## What Didn't Change

✓ Progress arc still shows media position (updates when HA sends position)  
✓ All other media controls work the same  
✓ All screens and navigation work the same  
✓ Light control still works the same  
✓ Weather screen still works the same  

**Only improvements**: Less errors, smoother volume control!
