# Ball V6 - Real-Time Progress Arc Fix

## Problem Statement

From the user:
> ball v6 the media arc doesn't update by itself, it only updates when i pause media. I want it to auto update every second while checking if its not rushing or being late compared to the real data.

## Issue Identified

The progress arc only updated when Home Assistant sent new `media_position` values. During playback, the arc appeared static and out of sync with actual media position because:

- `media_position` sensor doesn't auto-increment between HA updates
- No calculation of elapsed time during playback  
- Arc only reflected position when HA explicitly sent updates

**Result**: Arc appeared frozen during playback and didn't accurately reflect real-time media position.

## Solution Applied

Implemented real-time position calculation using timestamp-based elapsed time tracking. This approach:

1. **Records timestamp** when HA sends position updates
2. **Calculates elapsed time** since last update
3. **Adds elapsed time** to base position when media is playing
4. **Updates arc every second** with calculated real-time position

### Key Difference from V6.5/V6.8

Previous implementations (V6.5, V6.8) tried to use `ha_media_position_updated_at` sensor that read the `media_position_updated_at` attribute from Home Assistant. This caused errors because that attribute returns an **ISO 8601 timestamp string**, not a numeric Unix timestamp.

**This implementation** avoids that issue by:
- Using a **global variable** (`time_t` type) to track the timestamp locally
- Recording the timestamp using ESPHome's `ha_time.now().timestamp` when position updates arrive
- No sensor reading timestamp strings that can't be parsed

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Global Timestamp Variable (lines 1168-1171)

```yaml
- id: media_position_updated_at
  type: time_t
  restore_value: no
  initial_value: '0'
```

**Purpose**: Stores Unix timestamp of when `media_position` was last updated from Home Assistant.

### 2. Updated Media Position Sensor (lines 302-307)

```yaml
on_value:
  - lambda: |-
      // Record timestamp when position is updated from HA
      auto now = id(ha_time).now();
      if (now.is_valid()) {
        id(media_position_updated_at) = now.timestamp;
      }
  - lvgl.arc.update:
      # ... existing arc update code
```

**Purpose**: Every time Home Assistant sends a new position, record the current timestamp. This serves as the reference point for elapsed time calculations.

---

### 3. Added Per-Second Progress Arc Update (lines 355-391)

```yaml
# Update progress arc every second for real-time animation
- seconds: '*'
  then:
    - lvgl.arc.update:
        id: media_progress_arc
        value: !lambda |-
          // Get base position and other values
          float base_position = id(ha_media_position).state;
          float duration = id(ha_media_duration).state;
          time_t updated_at = id(media_position_updated_at);
          
          // Check if media is playing
          std::string state = id(ha_media_state).state;
          bool is_playing = (state == "playing");
          
          // Calculate real-time position
          float current_position = base_position;
          if (is_playing && updated_at > 0) {
            // Get current timestamp and calculate elapsed time
            auto now = id(ha_time).now();
            if (now.is_valid()) {
              time_t current_timestamp = now.timestamp;
              float elapsed = current_timestamp - updated_at;
              current_position = base_position + elapsed;
            }
          }
          
          // Calculate and return percentage
          if (duration > 0 && !std::isnan(current_position) && !std::isnan(duration)) {
            float percentage = (current_position / duration) * 100.0;
            // Clamp to 0-100 range
            if (percentage < 0) percentage = 0;
            if (percentage > 100) percentage = 100;
            return percentage;
          } else {
            return 0;
          }
```

**How It Works**:

1. **Every Second** → Lambda function executes
2. **Get Base Values**:
   - `base_position`: Last known position from HA (e.g., 45.2 seconds)
   - `duration`: Total track duration (e.g., 180.0 seconds)
   - `updated_at`: Timestamp when position was last updated (e.g., Unix timestamp)

3. **Check Playback State**:
   - If `state == "playing"` → Calculate elapsed time
   - If `state == "paused"` → Use static base position

4. **Calculate Elapsed Time** (when playing):
   ```cpp
   current_timestamp = now.timestamp;        // e.g., 1699564326
   updated_at = 1699564321;                  // when HA last sent position
   elapsed = current_timestamp - updated_at; // = 5 seconds
   current_position = base_position + elapsed; // = 45.2 + 5 = 50.2 seconds
   ```

5. **Calculate Percentage**:
   ```cpp
   percentage = (50.2 / 180.0) * 100.0 = 27.9%
   ```

6. **Clamp to Range**: Ensure percentage stays within 0-100%

7. **Update Arc**: Visual indicator animates to 27.9%

**Result**: Progress arc smoothly animates every second during playback, accurately reflecting real-time position.

## Technical Benefits

### Accuracy
- **Real-time tracking**: Arc updates every second based on elapsed time
- **Synchronized**: Position stays accurate between HA updates
- **Smart calculation**: Only calculates elapsed time when media is playing

### Reliability  
- **No conversion errors**: Uses native timestamp type (`time_t`), not string parsing
- **Simple approach**: Minimal additional complexity
- **Fail-safe**: Clamps percentage to valid range (0-100%)

### User Experience
- **Smooth animation**: Arc progresses continuously, not in jumps
- **Accurate feedback**: Visual position matches actual playback position
- **Responsive**: Updates immediately when media state changes

## Expected Behavior

### During Playback (Playing)
1. **Arc animates smoothly** every second
2. **Position calculated** as: `base_position + elapsed_time`
3. **Percentage increases** continuously until track ends
4. **Syncs with HA** when HA sends new position updates

### When Paused
1. **Arc stops animating** at current position
2. **Position remains static** (no elapsed time added)
3. **Percentage unchanged** until resumed or position updated by HA

### On Track Change
1. **Arc resets** to new track's position
2. **Base position updated** by HA
3. **Timestamp recorded** for new track
4. **Calculation continues** from new base position

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Real-Time Animation Test
1. Start playing media on configured media player
2. Navigate to media screen on Ball V6
3. **Verify**: Arc starts at current position and begins animating
4. **Watch**: Arc should advance smoothly every second
5. **Expected**: Arc percentage increases by ~0.5-1% per second (depending on track length)

### 2. Accuracy Test
1. Note the position shown in Home Assistant media player
2. Compare with arc position on Ball V6 display
3. **Verify**: Positions should match within 1-2 seconds
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. **Verify**: Arc has advanced ~10 seconds worth of percentage
6. **Expected**: Arc stays synchronized with actual playback

### 3. Pause/Resume Test
1. Pause media from Home Assistant
2. **Verify**: Arc immediately stops animating
3. **Verify**: Arc stays at paused position
4. Resume playback
5. **Verify**: Arc continues animating from current position
6. **Expected**: No jump or reset when pausing/resuming

### 4. Track Change Test
1. Skip to next track
2. **Verify**: Arc resets to new track's position (usually 0%)
3. **Verify**: Arc begins animating for new track
4. **Expected**: Smooth transition, no stuck at old position

### 5. State Change Test
1. Change media state from playing → paused → playing
2. **Verify**: Arc responds to each state change
3. **Expected**: Arc animates when playing, stops when paused

## Edge Cases Handled

### Clock Not Valid
If `ha_time` is not valid, the timestamp won't be recorded and arc will use base position only (falls back to original behavior).

### Timestamp Not Set
If `updated_at == 0`, elapsed time calculation is skipped and base position is used.

### Percentage Out of Range
Percentage is clamped to 0-100% to prevent display issues:
- If calculated < 0% → shows 0%
- If calculated > 100% → shows 100%

### Media State Unknown
If state is not "playing", arc uses static base position (same as paused behavior).

### NaN Values
All position and duration values are checked for NaN before calculation.
