# Ball V6.8 Changes

## Problem Statement (From User)
> Ball v6 since the media image display is not working remove everything related to it to save memory. Also the progress arc is not working as it should, there is a really big difference between the real state of the media and the displayed version on the arc. find the problem and fix it.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Album Art Not Working + Memory Waste ❌
- Album art display was implemented but not working properly
- Components consuming memory unnecessarily:
  - `http_request` component
  - `online_image` component with 100x100 RGB565 image buffer
  - `ha_media_picture` text sensor
  - `album_art_display` image widget
  - Token authentication system

### 2. Progress Arc Not Real-Time ❌
**Root Cause**: Progress arc only updated when Home Assistant sent new `media_position` values. During playback, the arc appeared static because:
- `media_position` sensor doesn't auto-increment between HA updates
- No calculation of elapsed time during playback
- Arc only reflected position when HA explicitly sent updates (e.g., on pause, skip)

**Result**: Large discrepancy between actual playback position and displayed arc position.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Album Art Components ✅

#### Removed HTTP Request Component (line 162-164)
```yaml
# REMOVED:
http_request:
  timeout: 10s
```

#### Removed Online Image Component (lines 166-173)
```yaml
# REMOVED:
online_image:
  - id: album_art_image
    url: "${ha_base_url}/"
    type: RGB565
    format: PNG
    resize: 100x100
    update_interval: never
```

**Memory Saved**:
- RGB565 100x100 image buffer: ~20KB
- HTTP request buffers
- Image processing overhead

#### Removed Configuration Parameters (lines 28-35)
```yaml
# REMOVED:
ha_base_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"
ha_token: ""
```

#### Removed Album Art Text Sensor (lines 1219-1248)
```yaml
# REMOVED entire ha_media_picture sensor with token authentication logic
```

#### Removed Album Art Display Widget (lines 1420-1427)
```yaml
# REMOVED:
- image:
    id: album_art_display
    src: album_art_image
    align: TOP_MID
    y: 30
    radius: 10
    border_width: 2
    border_color: 0x666666
```

#### Updated Progress Arc Styling
- Removed album art → progress arc now centered and more prominent
- Increased arc width from 4px to 6px for better visibility
- Arc now serves as the main visual element on media page

**Result**: Cleaner media page with focus on playback controls and progress visualization.

---

### 2. Real-Time Progress Arc Updates ✅

**Problem**: Progress arc only showed accurate position when Home Assistant sent updates, not during continuous playback.

**Solution**: Implement real-time position calculation using timestamp-based elapsed time tracking.

#### Added Media Position Updated At Sensor (lines 326-334)
```yaml
- platform: homeassistant
  id: ha_media_position_updated_at
  entity_id: ${media_player_entity}
  attribute: media_position_updated_at
  filters:
    - lambda: |-
        if (std::isnan(x)) return 0.0;
        return x;
```

**What It Does**: Tracks the Unix timestamp when `media_position` was last updated by Home Assistant.

#### Added Per-Second Progress Arc Update (lines 352-388)
```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_time
    on_time:
      # Update progress arc every second for real-time animation
      - seconds: '*'
        then:
          - lvgl.arc.update:
              id: media_progress_arc
              value: !lambda |-
                // Get base position and other values
                float base_position = id(ha_media_position).state;
                float duration = id(ha_media_duration).state;
                float updated_at = id(ha_media_position_updated_at).state;
                
                // Check if media is playing
                std::string state = id(ha_media_state).state;
                bool is_playing = (state == "playing");
                
                // Calculate real-time position
                float current_position = base_position;
                if (is_playing && !std::isnan(updated_at) && updated_at > 0) {
                  // Get current timestamp and calculate elapsed time
                  auto now = id(ha_time).now();
                  if (now.is_valid()) {
                    time_t current_timestamp = now.timestamp;
                    float elapsed = current_timestamp - updated_at;
                    current_position = base_position + elapsed;
                  }
                }
                
                // Calculate and return percentage
                if (duration > 0 && !std::isnan(current_position) && !std::isnan(duration)) {
                  float percentage = (current_position / duration) * 100.0;
                  // Clamp to 0-100 range
                  if (percentage < 0) percentage = 0;
                  if (percentage > 100) percentage = 100;
                  return percentage;
                } else {
                  return 0;
                }
```

**How It Works**:

1. **Every Second** → Lambda function executes
2. **Get Base Values**:
   - `base_position`: Last known position from HA (e.g., 45.2 seconds)
   - `duration`: Total track duration (e.g., 180.0 seconds)
   - `updated_at`: Timestamp when position was last updated (e.g., 1699564321)

3. **Check Playback State**:
   - If `state == "playing"` → Calculate elapsed time
   - If `state == "paused"` → Use static base position

4. **Calculate Elapsed Time** (when playing):
   ```cpp
   current_timestamp = now.timestamp;        // e.g., 1699564326 (5 seconds later)
   elapsed = current_timestamp - updated_at; // = 5 seconds
   current_position = base_position + elapsed; // = 45.2 + 5 = 50.2 seconds
   ```

5. **Calculate Percentage**:
   ```cpp
   percentage = (50.2 / 180.0) * 100.0 = 27.9%
   ```

6. **Clamp to Range**: Ensure percentage stays within 0-100%

7. **Update Arc**: Visual indicator animates to 27.9%

**Result**: Progress arc now smoothly animates every second during playback, accurately reflecting the real-time position of the media.

## Technical Benefits

### Memory Savings
- **~20KB** saved from album art image buffer
- HTTP request component removed
- Complex token authentication logic removed
- Simpler, more efficient configuration

### Real-Time Accuracy
- Arc updates **every second** during playback
- Accurately reflects **actual playback position**
- No more lag or frozen arc during playback
- Smooth visual feedback

### Improved User Experience
- Cleaner, focused media interface
- Reliable progress visualization
- Better performance with less memory usage
- No broken/non-functional features

## Testing Recommendations

### Progress Arc Verification
1. **Start Playing Media** → Arc should start at 0% and begin animating
2. **Watch During Playback** → Arc should smoothly advance every second
3. **Pause Media** → Arc should stop at current position (not jump or reset)
4. **Resume Media** → Arc should continue from paused position
5. **Skip Track** → Arc should reset to 0% and begin animating for new track

### Memory Verification
1. Check ESP32 free heap before/after (should see improvement)
2. Monitor system stability during extended use
3. Verify no out-of-memory errors in logs

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Arc animates smoothly every second
- ✅ Arc percentage matches actual playback position
- ✅ No lag between real position and displayed position
- ✅ Arc responds correctly to play/pause/skip
- ✅ Cleaner visual appearance without broken album art
