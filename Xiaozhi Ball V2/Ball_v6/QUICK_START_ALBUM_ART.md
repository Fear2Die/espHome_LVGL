# Quick Start Guide: Album Art Authentication

## üéØ Problem You're Solving

Album art not showing on your Xiaozhi Ball? Getting blank images or errors in logs?

**The issue:** Home Assistant requires authentication to access album art images. Without it, you get **401 Unauthorized** errors.

**The solution:** Add a long-lived access token to authenticate your ESPHome device.

## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Token in Home Assistant (2 min)

1. Open Home Assistant in your browser
2. Click **Profile Icon** (bottom left) ‚Üí **Profile**
3. Scroll to **Long-Lived Access Tokens**
4. Click **Create Token**
5. Name it: `ESPHome Display` (or any name)
6. **Copy the token** ‚Üí You won't see it again!

   Example token:
   ```
   eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhYmNkZWYxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg5MDAwMDAwLCJleHAiOjIwMDQzNjAwMDB9.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
   ```

### Step 2: Add Token to Configuration (1 min)

1. Open your `Ball_v6.yaml` (or v5.3, v5.4, v6.2)
2. Find the **substitutions** section at the top
3. Look for this line:
   ```yaml
   ha_token: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token:
   ```yaml
   ha_token: "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
   ```

### Step 3: Flash Updated Config (2 min)

1. Save the YAML file
2. In ESPHome dashboard, click **Install** on your Ball device
3. Wait for compilation and flashing
4. Device will reboot automatically

### Step 4: Test It! (30 sec)

1. Start playing music on your media player
2. Navigate to media screen on your Ball device
3. **Album art should appear within 5-10 seconds!** üéâ

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification

### It's Working If:
- ‚úÖ Album art appears on media screen
- ‚úÖ Art updates when you change tracks
- ‚úÖ No errors in ESPHome logs
- ‚úÖ Different media sources all show art (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.)

### Still Not Working?

#### Check 1: Token Format
```yaml
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Plain token string
ha_token: "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL..."

# ‚ùå WRONG - Extra quotes or spaces
ha_token: ""eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...""
ha_token: " eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL... "
```

#### Check 2: ESPHome Logs
In ESPHome, click **Logs** for your device and look for:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Image downloaded successfully"
‚ùå Bad: "401 Unauthorized"
‚ùå Bad: "HTTP request failed"
```

#### Check 3: Home Assistant URL
If using IP address instead of `homeassistant.local`:
```yaml
# Find this line in the YAML (around line 1274 for v6)
url = "http://homeassistant.local:8123" + x + "?authSig=" + token;

# Change to your HA IP:
url = "http://192.168.1.100:8123" + x + "?authSig=" + token;
```

#### Check 4: Media Player Has Album Art
1. In Home Assistant: **Developer Tools** ‚Üí **States**
2. Find your media player entity
3. Look for `entity_picture` attribute
4. If missing, your media source doesn't provide album art

## üîí Security Tips

### Keep Your Token Safe
- ‚úÖ Don't commit token to public Git repos
- ‚úÖ Don't share config files with token
- ‚úÖ Use Home Assistant secrets if sharing code
- ‚úÖ Revoke and recreate if compromised

### Example with Secrets (Optional)
```yaml
# In secrets.yaml
ha_access_token: "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL..."

# In Ball_v6.yaml
ha_token: !secret ha_access_token
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" in logs
**Fix:** Token is missing, incorrect, or expired
- Recreate token in Home Assistant
- Copy it carefully (no spaces)
- Update YAML and reflash

### Issue: Album art shows briefly then disappears
**Fix:** Network/timeout issue
- Increase `http_request` timeout in YAML:
  ```yaml
  http_request:
    timeout: 20s  # Was 10s
  ```

### Issue: Some albums show art, others don't
**Fix:** This is normal - depends on media source
- Not all tracks have album art
- Some sources provide higher quality art
- ESPHome resizes to 100x100 automatically

### Issue: Token in logs (security concern)
**Fix:** ESPHome doesn't log tokens by default
- If you see it, you may have debug logging enabled
- Check your `logger:` configuration
- Tokens are safe in device memory
