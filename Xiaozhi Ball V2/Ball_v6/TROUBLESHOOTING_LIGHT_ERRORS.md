# Troubleshooting Light Entity "Can't convert 'None' to number!" Error

## Problem

You're seeing this error in your ESPHome logs:
```
Ball Assistant V2: [W][homeassistant.sensor:015]: 'light.living_room_lamp': Can't convert 'None' to number!
```

## Understanding the Error

This error occurs when the `ha_light_brightness` sensor tries to read the `brightness` attribute from your light entity, but receives a `None` (null) value. This can happen in several situations:

1. **The light entity doesn't exist** in Home Assistant
2. **The light doesn't support brightness** (simple on/off lights)
3. **The light is unavailable** (offline, not responding, or during Home Assistant startup)
4. **Missing filter configuration** (if using an older version)

## Quick Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check if the Entity Exists

1. Open Home Assistant web interface
2. Go to **Developer Tools** → **States**
3. Search for your light entity (e.g., `light.living_room_lamp`)
4. **If not found**: Your entity ID is incorrect or the light isn't configured

### Step 2: Check if the Light Supports Brightness

1. In Developer Tools → States, find your light entity
2. Click on the entity to see its details
3. Look at the **Attributes** section
4. Check if there's a `brightness` attribute listed

**Example - Light WITH brightness support:**
```yaml
State: on
Attributes:
  brightness: 128        # ← This means it supports brightness
  friendly_name: Living Room Lamp
  supported_features: 41
```

**Example - Light WITHOUT brightness support:**
```yaml
State: on
Attributes:
  friendly_name: Living Room Switch
  supported_features: 0  # ← No brightness attribute
```

### Step 3: Verify Ball V6 Configuration

Check your `Ball_v6.yaml` file around line 215-222:

**✅ CORRECT Configuration (with filter):**
```yaml
  # Home Assistant light brightness sensor (0-255)
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_light_brightness
    entity_id: ${light_entity}
    attribute: brightness
    filters:                          # ← These lines prevent the error
      - lambda: |-
          if (std::isnan(x)) return 0.0;
          return x;
    on_value:
      - lambda: 'id(updating_light_from_ha) = true;'
      - lvgl.slider.update:
          id: brightness_slider
          value: !lambda 'return (x / 255.0) * 100.0;'
      - lambda: 'id(updating_light_from_ha) = false;'
```

**❌ MISSING Filter (if you see this, add the filters section):**
```yaml
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_light_brightness
    entity_id: ${light_entity}
    attribute: brightness
    # Missing filters section! ← This causes the error
    on_value:
      - lambda: 'id(updating_light_from_ha) = true;'
      # ... rest of config
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Incorrect Entity ID

If your light entity doesn't exist, update the `substitutions` section at the top of `Ball_v6.yaml`:

```yaml
substitutions:
  # ... other settings ...
  light_entity: "light.living_room_lamp"  # ← Make sure this matches your actual entity ID
```

To find the correct entity ID:
1. Go to Home Assistant → Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find your light integration
3. Click on it to see all entities
4. Copy the exact entity ID (including the `light.` prefix)

### Solution 2: Use a Light that Supports Brightness

If your current light doesn't support brightness:

**Option A: Choose a different light**
Update the `light_entity` in substitutions to point to a dimmable light.

**Option B: Accept the limitation**
Keep your current light, but understand:
- The brightness slider won't work (it will always show 0% or 100%)
- The light switch (toggle) will still work fine
- The error will persist (but can be ignored)

### Solution 3: Add Missing Filter (Older Versions)

If you're using an older version of Ball V6 without the filter, add it manually:

1. Open your `Ball_v6.yaml` file
2. Find the `ha_light_brightness` sensor (around line 215)
3. Add the `filters` section:

```yaml
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_light_brightness
    entity_id: ${light_entity}
    attribute: brightness
    filters:                          # ← ADD THESE 4 LINES
      - lambda: |-
          if (std::isnan(x)) return 0.0;
          return x;
    on_value:
      # ... existing on_value code stays the same
```

4. Save the file and reflash your device

### Solution 4: Update to Latest Ball V6

The latest version of Ball V6 includes filters on ALL Home Assistant sensors:
- Light brightness (ha_light_brightness)
- Weather temperature (ha_weather_temperature)
- Weather humidity (ha_weather_humidity)
- Media volume (ha_media_volume)
- Media position (ha_media_position)
- Media duration (ha_media_duration)

**To update:**
1. Download the latest `Ball_v6.yaml` from the repository
2. Copy your entity IDs from your old configuration:
   ```yaml
   substitutions:
     light_entity: "light.YOUR_LIGHT"           # Copy these
     media_player_entity: "media_player.YOUR_MEDIA"
     weather_entity: "weather.YOUR_WEATHER"
   ```
3. Paste them into the new file
4. Flash to your device

## Verification

After applying the fix, monitor your ESPHome logs for 5-10 minutes:

**✅ Success - No more errors:**
```log
[INFO] ESPHome logs
[INFO] Connected to Home Assistant
[INFO] Light brightness updated: 128
[INFO] Clean logs, no warnings
```

**❌ Still seeing errors:**
```log
[W][homeassistant.sensor:015]: 'light.living_room_lamp': Can't convert 'None' to number!
```

If still seeing errors after applying the fix:
1. **Double-check the filter syntax** - ensure proper indentation (2 spaces per level)
2. **Verify you saved and reflashed** the updated configuration
3. **Check Home Assistant logs** for connection issues with the light
4. **Restart Home Assistant** to ensure the entity is fully initialized

## Special Cases

### Case 1: Error Only at Startup

If you only see the error when ESPHome first boots up:
- **This is normal** during the first few seconds
- Home Assistant connection is establishing
- The filter will catch subsequent updates
- **No action needed** if errors stop after 30-60 seconds

### Case 2: Error Persists Even with Filter

If you have the filter but still see errors:
- **Check your light entity status in Home Assistant**
- The entity might be truly unavailable (offline device)
- Check Home Assistant → Settings → Devices & Services
- Look for warnings or unavailable status on your light

### Case 3: Light Works but Error Appears Occasionally

If the light works fine but you see occasional errors:
- **Network/connectivity issues** between Home Assistant and the light
- The light might be temporarily unavailable
- **This is expected behavior** - the filter handles it gracefully
- The display will show default values during unavailability
