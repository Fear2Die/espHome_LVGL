# Quick Fix Summary - Ball V6 Timestamp Conversion Error

## Problem
```
[W][homeassistant.sensor:015]: 'media_player.player': Can't convert '2025-10-11 13:09:18.845425+00:00' to number!
```

## Root Cause
The `ha_media_position_updated_at` sensor was trying to read an ISO 8601 timestamp string as a numeric value.

## Fix Applied
✅ Removed `ha_media_position_updated_at` sensor (10 lines)  
✅ Removed time-based progress arc update (44 lines)  
✅ Kept simple progress arc updates from HA position changes  

## Result
✅ No more timestamp conversion errors  
✅ Progress arc still updates during playback (via HA updates)  
✅ Simpler, more reliable code (-54 lines)  

## What Still Works
- ✅ Progress arc shows media position
- ✅ Arc updates as media plays (HA sends periodic updates)
- ✅ Volume slider control
- ✅ Media playback controls
- ✅ All other Ball V6 features

## Deployment
Just flash the updated `Ball_v6.yaml` to your device. No configuration changes needed.
