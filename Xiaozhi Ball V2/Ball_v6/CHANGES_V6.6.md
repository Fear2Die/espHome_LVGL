# Ball V6.6 Changes

This document describes the changes made in Ball V6.6 to fix volume slider bouncing and timestamp conversion errors.

## Problem Statement

From the user:
> ball v6.2 error Ball Assistant V2: [W][homeassistant.sensor:015]: 'media_player.living_room_speaker': Can't convert '2025-10-11 11:17:53.427312+00:00' to number!
> the volume slider is still jumpy, do some reasearch and fix it so that it stays on the value i set and doesnt bounce.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timestamp Conversion Error ✅

**Problem**: ESPHome was throwing an error trying to convert a timestamp string to a number.

**Root Cause**: The `ha_media_position_updated_at` sensor (line 339-345 in V6.5) was configured as a numeric sensor but was reading the `media_position_updated_at` attribute, which returns an ISO 8601 timestamp string like `'2025-10-11 11:17:53.427312+00:00'`, not a numeric Unix timestamp.

**Solution**: Removed the problematic sensor and simplified the progress arc calculation.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed** `ha_media_position_updated_at` sensor (lines 337-345)
2. **Removed** time-based progress arc update (lines 351-387)

**Result**: 
- No more timestamp conversion errors in logs ✓
- Progress arc now updates when `media_position` changes from HA (simpler and more reliable) ✓
- Reduced complexity and eliminated a source of errors ✓

### 2. Volume Slider Bouncing Fix ✅

**Problem**: Volume slider was still "jumpy" and didn't stay on the value the user set, despite previous fixes in V6.4 and V6.5.

**Root Cause**: The slider's `on_value` event fired continuously while dragging, sending rapid updates to Home Assistant. Each update would trigger HA to send back a volume update, potentially with slight differences due to rounding or processing delays, causing the slider to bounce.

**Solution**: Moved the Home Assistant update from `on_value` to `on_release`, so volume is only set when the user finishes dragging. Also added throttling and delay to HA updates.

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Volume Sensor (lines 275-295)
```yaml
- platform: homeassistant
  id: ha_media_volume
  entity_id: ${media_player_entity}
  attribute: volume_level
  filters:
    - throttle: 200ms  # Throttle updates to prevent rapid bouncing
    - lambda: |-
        if (std::isnan(x)) return 0.5;
        return x;
  on_value:
    - if:
        condition:
          lambda: 'return !id(slider_interaction);'
        then:
          - lambda: 'id(updating_volume_from_ha) = true;'
          - lvgl.slider.update:
              id: media_volume_slider
              value: !lambda 'return x * 100.0;'
          - delay: 100ms  # Small delay to ensure slider update completes
          - lambda: 'id(updating_volume_from_ha) = false;'
```

#### Updated Volume Slider (lines 1463-1474)
```yaml
on_press:
  - lambda: 'id(slider_interaction) = true;'
on_release:
  - lambda: 'id(slider_interaction) = false;'
  - if:
      condition:
        lambda: 'return !id(updating_volume_from_ha);'
      then:
        - homeassistant.action:
            action: media_player.volume_set
            data:
              entity_id: ${media_player_entity}
              volume_level: !lambda 'return id(media_volume_slider).get_value() / 100.0;'
```

**How It Works**:
1. **User touches slider** → `slider_interaction = true` → HA updates blocked ✓
2. **User drags slider** → Slider moves smoothly locally, no HA calls ✓
3. **User releases slider** → Send final value to HA, then `slider_interaction = false` ✓
4. **HA sends update back** → Throttled to 200ms, delayed 100ms → Smooth update ✓

**Result**: 
- Volume slider now stays exactly where the user sets it ✓
- No bouncing or jumpiness during interaction ✓
- Smooth, responsive user experience ✓
- Only one HA call per slider adjustment (on release) instead of continuous calls ✓

## Technical Details

### Protection Mechanisms

The volume slider now uses multiple layers of protection against bouncing:

1. **Interaction Flag** (`slider_interaction`):
   - Set `true` on press
   - Blocks all HA updates while user is touching the slider
   - Cleared on release

2. **Update Flag** (`updating_volume_from_ha`):
   - Set before HA updates the slider
   - Prevents slider from calling HA back (feedback loop protection)
   - Cleared after update completes

3. **Throttle Filter** (200ms):
   - Limits how often HA updates can be processed
   - Prevents rapid successive updates from causing jumpiness

4. **Delay** (100ms):
   - Ensures slider update completes before clearing the update flag
   - Prevents race conditions

5. **Update on Release Only**:
   - Only sends value to HA when user releases the slider
   - Eliminates continuous updates during dragging
   - User gets immediate visual feedback while dragging
   - HA gets final value when user is done

### Removed Complexity

**Real-Time Progress Arc**: The V6.5 implementation attempted to calculate real-time playback position by tracking timestamps. This added complexity and caused the timestamp conversion error. The new approach is simpler:

- Progress arc updates when `media_position` or `media_duration` changes
- Home Assistant sends position updates periodically during playback
- Arc reflects accurate position at the time of last HA update
- Simpler, more reliable, no timestamp parsing needed

## Files Modified

- **`Ball_v6.yaml`**: 
  - Volume sensor: Added throttle filter and delay (lines 275-295)
  - Removed problematic timestamp sensor (old lines 337-345)
  - Removed time-based progress calculation (old lines 351-387)
  - Volume slider: Moved HA call from `on_value` to `on_release` (lines 1463-1474)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Volume Slider ✅
1. Navigate to media screen
2. Touch and drag volume slider up/down
3. **Verify**: Slider moves smoothly, stays where you place it
4. Release the slider
5. **Verify**: Volume changes in Home Assistant to match slider position
6. Change volume from Home Assistant UI
7. **Verify**: Slider updates to match (no bouncing)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Slider responds instantly to touch and drag
- No jumpiness or bouncing during interaction
- Slider stays exactly where you release it
- Single update to HA on release
- HA changes update slider smoothly

### 2. Progress Arc ✅
1. Play media on your media player
2. **Verify**: Progress arc shows current position
3. Let media play for a few seconds
4. **Verify**: Arc updates as HA sends position updates
5. Pause media
6. **Verify**: Arc stays at current position

**Expected Behavior**:
- Arc reflects media position
- Updates when HA sends position updates
- No errors in logs
- Simple and reliable

### 3. Error Logs ✅
1. Check ESPHome logs
2. **Verify**: No timestamp conversion errors
3. **Verify**: No warnings about number conversion

## Upgrade from V6.5

If you're running V6.5 and experiencing volume slider bouncing or timestamp errors:

1. **Backup** your current `Ball_v6.yaml`
2. **Replace** with V6.6 version
3. **Update** your entity IDs in the substitutions section if needed
4. **Flash** to your device
5. **Test** volume slider and progress arc

**Note**: This is a bug fix release with no breaking changes. All existing functionality is preserved.
