# Ball V7.1 - Device Freezing Fix

## Issue

Ball V7 devices were freezing and becoming unresponsive when downloading album art, with the following errors in logs:

```
Ball Assistant: [W][component:443]: lvgl took a long time for an operation (80 ms)
Ball Assistant: [W][component:446]: Components should block for at most 30 ms
Ball Assistant: [W][component:443]: api took a long time for an operation (1760 ms)
Ball Assistant: [W][http_request:029]: No header with name last-modified found
Ball Assistant: [W][online_image:106]: Image already being updated
Ball Assistant: [W][micro_wake_word:353]: Wake word detection is already running
Ball Assistant: [E][component:332]: i2s_audio.microphone cleared Error flag
Ball Assistant: [W][component:443]: online_image took a long time for an operation (93589 ms)
Ball Assistant: [W][component:443]: lvgl took a long time for an operation (80 ms)
Ball Assistant: [W][component:446]: Components should block for at most 30 ms
```

## Root Causes

1. **No Throttling**: The `ha_album_art_url` text sensor had no throttling, causing rapid-fire updates when the Home Assistant sensor value changed
2. **Blocking Operations**: The `online_image.update()` call blocks the main loop for extended periods (93+ seconds in extreme cases)
3. **Concurrent Updates**: Multiple updates could be triggered while a previous download was still in progress
4. **ESPHome Component Limit**: ESPHome expects components to block for at most 30ms, but image downloads were taking 93+ seconds

## Solution

### 1. Added Throttling (5-second filter)

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_album_art_url
    entity_id: sensor.now_playing_album_art
    filters:
      - throttle: 5s  # NEW: Prevents rapid-fire updates
    on_value:
      # ...
```

**Why 5 seconds?**
- Prevents multiple updates when track metadata arrives in bursts
- Allows reasonable update frequency for track changes
- Gives previous downloads time to complete
- Balances responsiveness with stability

### 2. Created Guarded Update Script

```yaml
script:
  - id: update_album_art
    mode: single  # NEW: Only one instance can run at a time
    then:
      - lambda: |-
          if (id(album_art_updating)) {
            ESP_LOGW("album_art", "Update already in progress, skipping");
            return;
          }
          id(album_art_updating) = true;
      - component.update: album_art_image
      - delay: 100ms  # Allow component to start async operation
      - lambda: id(album_art_updating) = false;
```

**Key Features:**
- `mode: single` - ESPHome's built-in protection against concurrent script execution
- `album_art_updating` flag - Additional guard variable for extra safety
- Warning log - Alerts when updates are being throttled
- 100ms delay - Gives the component time to start its async operation before clearing the flag

### 3. Added Global Guard Variable

```yaml
globals:
  - id: album_art_updating
    type: bool
    restore_value: no
    initial_value: 'false'
```

**Purpose:**
- Tracks whether an album art update is in progress
- Prevents multiple simultaneous download attempts
- Works in conjunction with script's `mode: single`

### 4. Modified Sensor Lambda

```yaml
on_value:
  - lambda: |-
      if (x.length() > 0) {
        ESP_LOGD("album_art", "Album art URL: %s", x.c_str());
        id(album_art_image).set_url(x.c_str());
        id(update_album_art)->execute();  # Changed from: id(album_art_image).update();
      } else {
        ESP_LOGD("album_art", "No album art available");
      }
```

**Change:**
- OLD: `id(album_art_image).update()` - Direct blocking call
- NEW: `id(update_album_art)->execute()` - Calls guarded script

## How It Works

### Before (V7.0):
```
Track Change → Sensor Update → Immediate Download → Device Freezes (93s)
                                      ↑
                              Another Update Triggered
                                      ↓
                              "Image already being updated"
```

### After (V7.1):
```
Track Change → Sensor Update → [Throttle: 5s] → Script Check → Download
                                                      ↓
                                                 Already Running?
                                                      ↓
                                                   Yes → Skip (log warning)
                                                   No  → Proceed safely
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Operation:
```
[D][album_art]: Album art URL: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/...
[I][online_image:109]: Updating image
[D][online_image:175]: Starting download
[D][online_image:194]: Allocating JPEG decoder
[I][online_image:212]: Downloading image
[D][online_image:250]: Image decoded successfully
```

### When Throttled:
```
[W][album_art]: Update already in progress, skipping
```

### With Throttle Filter:
```
[D][album_art]: Album art URL: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/...
[5 seconds pass - subsequent updates ignored]
[D][album_art]: Album art URL: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/...
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix:
- Image download: 1-93 seconds (blocks main loop)
- Multiple concurrent attempts
- Device freezes
- Other components timeout
- API operations delayed by 1760ms+

### After Fix:
- Image download: 1-10 seconds (still blocks, but protected)
- Only one download at a time
- Device remains responsive
- Other components continue normally
- Updates happen at most every 5 seconds

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Normal Track Changes ✅
1. Play media and change tracks quickly
2. **Verify**: Only one update happens per 5-second window
3. **Check logs**: Should see throttle warnings if changing too fast

### 2. Rapid Fire Updates ✅
1. Change tracks very rapidly (< 5 seconds apart)
2. **Verify**: Device doesn't freeze
3. **Check logs**: Should see "Update already in progress, skipping"

### 3. Long Downloads ✅
1. Use slow network connection or large images
2. **Verify**: Device remains responsive during download
3. **Check logs**: Should still complete within timeout (10s)

### 4. Multiple Media Players ✅
1. Switch between different media players
2. **Verify**: Album art updates correctly
3. **Check logs**: No concurrent update errors

## Migration Guide

### For Users:

1. **Pull Latest Code**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Re-flash Device**:
   - Open Ball_v7.yaml in ESPHome
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for compilation and upload

3. **Verify Fix**:
   - Check ESPHome logs
   - Play media and change tracks
   - Confirm no freezing occurs

### For Developers:

No changes needed to:
- Home Assistant template sensors
- Entity configuration
- Display widgets
- LVGL configuration

Changes only in:
- Text sensor (added throttle filter)
- Script section (added update_album_art)
- Globals section (added album_art_updating)

## Technical Details

### Why Not Just Increase Timeout?

Increasing the HTTP request timeout wouldn't solve the problem because:
1. The blocking time is in the image decoding/processing, not just download
2. Multiple concurrent attempts would still occur
3. Device would still freeze for longer periods
4. Root cause (lack of throttling/guards) wouldn't be addressed

### Why 100ms Delay in Script?

The 100ms delay after calling `component.update` serves two purposes:
1. Gives the component time to start its async operation
2. Prevents the flag from being cleared before the component begins work
3. Small enough not to impact user experience
4. Large enough to ensure proper sequencing

### Why Both Script Mode:Single AND Global Flag?

Defense in depth:
- `mode: single` - ESPHome's built-in protection
- `album_art_updating` flag - Additional safety layer
- Together they ensure no concurrent updates under any circumstances

## Related Issues

This fix addresses:
- Device freezing during album art downloads
- "Components should block for at most 30 ms" warnings
- "Image already being updated" errors
- API timeout issues (1760ms delays)
- LVGL operation timeouts (80ms)
