# Ball V7.2 - Quick Fix Summary

## Problem
Device was **still freezing** even after V7.1 with these errors:
```
[W][component:443]: online_image took a long time for an operation (108215 ms)
[W][component:446]: Components should block for at most 30 ms
```

Device would freeze for 100+ seconds during album art updates.

## Root Cause (V7.1 Issue)
V7.1 prevented concurrent updates but **still used blocking calls**:
```yaml
- component.update: album_art_image  # ‚ùå SYNCHRONOUS - Blocks for 100+ seconds!
```

This is a **synchronous blocking call** that downloads the entire image before continuing.

## Solution (V7.2 - 1 Simple Change)

### Removed Blocking Call üöÄ
```yaml
# Lines 955-962 - V7.2 (NON-BLOCKING):
- id: update_album_art
  mode: single
  then:
    - lambda: |-
        // Just log that we're setting a new URL
        // The online_image component will fetch the image lazily when displayed
        // This prevents blocking the main loop with synchronous downloads
        ESP_LOGD("album_art", "Album art URL updated, image will load on display");
```

**Effect**: 
- ‚úÖ No blocking download
- ‚úÖ Images load asynchronously when displayed
- ‚úÖ Device stays responsive
- ‚úÖ Removed unused `album_art_updating` global variable

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Pull & Flash (Recommended)
```bash
git pull origin main
# Flash Ball_v7.yaml to your device
```

### Option 2: Manual Edit
If you have customizations, apply these changes to your config:
1. In `update_album_art` script: Remove `component.update: album_art_image` line
2. In `update_album_art` script: Replace with log-only lambda (see above)
3. Remove `album_art_updating` global variable (no longer needed)

## Testing
After flashing:
1. Play media and change tracks rapidly
2. Device should remain fully responsive
3. Album art should appear within 2-3 seconds
4. Check logs - should see: `[D][album_art]: Album art URL updated, image will load on display`
5. No more "took a long time" warnings!

## Impact
- ‚úÖ Device fully responsive at all times
- ‚úÖ No more 100+ second freezes
- ‚úÖ No blocking operations
- ‚úÖ Album art loads asynchronously in background
- ‚úÖ Touch, voice, and display all work immediately
