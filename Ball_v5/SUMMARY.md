## Common Questions

### Q: Can I upgrade from Ball V4 to Ball V5?
**A**: Yes! Copy your secrets.yaml, add media player and weather entities, and flash Ball_v5.yaml.

### Q: Do I need all three entities?
**A**: Yes, all three are required (light, media_player, weather). You can use dummy entities if you don't use certain features.

### Q: Will my Ball V4 automations still work?
**A**: Yes, all Ball V4 features are maintained. Only additions, no breaking changes to existing functionality.

### Q: Can I add more lights?
**A**: Currently supports one light. Adding more would require custom YAML modifications and layout changes.

### Q: Does media player show album artwork?
**A**: No, due to display size (240x240) and memory limitations, only text info is shown.

### Q: What media players are supported?
**A**: Any Home Assistant media_player entity (Spotify, Plex, VLC, etc.)

### Q: Can I customize the colors?
**A**: Yes, edit the bg_color values in Ball_v5.yaml. Documentation includes color codes.

**A**: No, only current conditions. Future versions may add forecast support.

### Q: How often does weather update?
**A**: Updates automatically when the weather entity changes in Home Assistant (typically every 15-30 minutes).

### Q: Can I use Fahrenheit instead of Celsius?
**A**: Yes, modify the temperature label lambda to convert ¬∞C to ¬∞F. Example in QUICK_START.md.
