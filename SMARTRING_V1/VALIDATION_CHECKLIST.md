## Phase 1: Configuration Validation

### YAML Syntax Check
```bash
esphome config SMARTRING_V1.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Configuration validates successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ No errors about display driver (mipi_spi supports QSPI)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No errors about touch controller (cst816 supports CST820)

**If Failed**:
- Check YAML indentation
- Verify all substitutions are defined
- Check for typos in component names
- Ensure ESPHome version is 2024.11.0 or newer

---

## Phase 2: Compilation Test

### Compile Firmware
```bash
esphome compile SMARTRING_V1.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:
