# SMARTRING V1 Validation Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRE-TESTING WARNING

This configuration has CRITICAL hardware incompatibilities with ESPHome. Most features will NOT work without custom development. Use this checklist to systematically test what does and doesn't work.

---

## Phase 1: Configuration Validation

### YAML Syntax Check
```bash
esphome config SMARTRING_V1.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Configuration validates successfully
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about unknown display driver (expected)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about pin configurations (expected)

**If Failed**:
- Check YAML indentation
- Verify all substitutions are defined
- Check for typos in component names

---

## Phase 2: Compilation Test

### Compile Firmware
```bash
esphome compile SMARTRING_V1.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Compilation completes (unlikely due to display driver issues)
- [ ] üî¥ Compilation fails with display initialization errors (likely)
- [ ] üî¥ Errors about missing display driver support (likely)

**Common Errors**:
- `Display driver 'GC9A01A' does not support QSPI`
- `Unknown display model`
- `Pin configuration invalid for display type`

**If Compilation Fails**:
- Expected behavior - display driver not supported
- Document specific error messages
- Consider developing custom component
- Consider switching to Arduino framework

**If Compilation Succeeds** (unlikely):
- Proceed to Phase 3
- Be prepared for runtime errors

---

## Phase 3: Upload Test (Only if compilation succeeded)

### Flash Firmware
```bash
esphome upload SMARTRING_V1.yaml
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Upload completes
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Device reboots

**Watch for**:
- Upload progress bar completes 100%
- Serial output shows reboot message
- Device LED activity

---

## Phase 4: Basic Connectivity Tests

### Test 1: Serial Output
```bash

### Test 3: Home Assistant API
**Check for**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ API connection established
- [ ] ‚úÖ Device appears in Home Assistant
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Entities available (even if not functional)

**Serial Output Should Show**:
```
[I][api:xxx] Client connected
[I][api:xxx] Home Assistant API connected
```

## Phase 5: Component-by-Component Testing

### üü¢ Component 1: LED (Should Work)
**Test Procedure**:
1. Find "LED Ring" entity in Home Assistant
2. Turn on LED
3. Change color to red, green, blue
4. Test effects (pulse)

**Validation**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ LED turns on/off
- [ ] ‚úÖ Color changes work
- [ ] ‚úÖ Brightness control works
- [ ] ‚úÖ Effects work (pulse)

**If Failed**:
- Check GPIO39 connection
- Verify LED is WS2812

3. Short press (single click)
4. Long press (>2 seconds)

**Validation**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Button press detected in logs
- [ ] ‚úÖ Single click triggers voice assistant
- [ ] ‚úÖ Long press toggles mute

**Serial Output Should Show**:
```
[D][button:xxx] Single click detected
[D][button:xxx] Long press detected
```

**If Failed**:

---

### üî¥ Component 3: Display (Will Fail)
**Test Procedure**:
1. Power on device
2. Check for any display activity
3. Monitor serial output

**Expected Result**:
- [ ] üî¥ Display does NOT initialize (confirmed)
- [ ] üî¥ No image appears on screen

**Serial Output Will Show**:
```
[E][display:xxx] Display initialization failed
[E][display:xxx] QSPI not supported
[E][display:xxx] CO5300 driver not found
```

**This is EXPECTED** - ESPHome does not support QSPI displays

**Troubleshooting Steps** (won't fix issue):
- ‚ùå Changing pin configuration (won't help - protocol issue)
- ‚ùå Different display model selection (CO5300 not available)
- ‚úÖ Document error messages for custom component development
- ‚úÖ Test backlight separately if possible

- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è Touch coordinates appear in logs
- [ ] üî¥ Touch events not detected (likely)

**Serial Output**:
```
[I][i2c:xxx] I2C scan found device at address 0xXX
[D][touch:xxx] Touch detected at x=XX y=YY
```
OR
```
[W][i2c:xxx] No device found at expected address
[E][touch:xxx] CST9217 not compatible with CST816 driver
```

**If Touch Works**:

- LVGL integration available
- Working code exists

**Option C: Use ESP-IDF**
- Use VIEWE-SMARTRING ESP-IDF examples
- Complete hardware support
- LVGL integration available
- More low-level control

**Recommendation**: Option B (Arduino) for fastest working solution
